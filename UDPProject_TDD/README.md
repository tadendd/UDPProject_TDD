This part of the project will detail how the programs within the project are supposed to go. The main part of the program is 
the UDP Test, which features the main method and will run both the client and the server together. The UDPServer has most of 
the essentials of this project. The quotes, as well as their format will all be connected through here. It will also be receiving
the signal from the client, while the client will send its part. That will also be the main part of the client, as well as send a 
message to the server. The client will also send for a signal to be recieved by the test and will also help in binding the IP address
with the port number. The UDPServer will print out the Quotes while the UDPClient will recieve the entries from the server. There
will also be marked points where the user will have to change the IP address to fit the programs specifications. This will be marked
as comments in both the UDPServer and the UDPClient, while the UDPTest will still run both. Also, I was the only one to have
worked on this project. There was no team. The output should also come out from the console of the program that is being used, which
is what happened to me when I was on Eclipse. The dates and data should also be printed out together as strings.
